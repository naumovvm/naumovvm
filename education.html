            I started my education at my local school in my hometown, Kavadarci. <br>
            I chose this school mainly because it had great teachers, it was super
            close to my house and many people from my family have studied there.<br>
            I went there for 9 years, starting from 2010 to 2019. <Br>
            I met most of the people I know today there and learned pretty valuable things too. <br>
            Also this is the place where I really got into computers and physics as a kid.

            I continued my education at my local high school in Kavadarci. <Br>
            There are four high schools in Kavadarci, but I chose this one because
            it is the most sophisticated school and has the best teacher in town. <br>
            I learned many things here and with the help of my professors, my love for
            computers and physics grew. <br>
            I also met some of my greatest friends here, with whom I am currently attending
            university. <br>
            This is the place where I made up my mind about university and what I
            want to do later on in my life.

            After high school, I continued my education at FCSE, Skopje. <br>
            I am currently studying to get a degree for "Application of information technologies". <br>
            From the three phases of my education, I like university the most because you
            actually learn useful things here and also meet a lot of people from all around the country. <br>
            A major downside at FCSE is the lack of a university building (hence the question mark picture),
            but other than that the experience has been pretty good so far.
