        I was born on September 18, 2004, in the vibrant town of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vvMP6kbdh9BamhP99">Kavadarci, Macedonia.</a><br>
        I grew up in a loving family with my supportive parents and my older brother. <br>
        My family has always been a constant source of encouragement and
        inspiration throughout my life. <br>
        Throughout my life I have been interested in many things, from physics and
        astronomy to computers and how they work. <br>
        From a young age I was always taking apart computers and putting them back together.
        It was always interesting to me to see how everything worked on the hardware side.
        Then I started tinkering on the software side too, learning programming languages
        and developing little projects from time to time. <br>
        I also like to take pictures of everything, from nature to animals to urban scenery. <br>
        I have taken an interest in astrophotography, slowly gathering equipment to photograph the night sky. <br>
        I am also a gear head and a cyclist, going on solo trips to beautiful spots.
