        I have aquired many skills over the years, in all sorts of fields.<br>
        Since being interested in photography and all of that, the field of photo editing and video editing has also
        caught my eye.
        <Br>So, that's why I am very experienced in Adobe products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro.
        <br>I am also an amateur guitarist for three years now, playing music for myself or friends.
        <br>When I started university, I took interest in cooking since I live with my two roommates, with no parents.
        I haven't cooked before, so I am very proud of the progress I have made in my first year of university.
